NAME
    Module::Install::AuthorRequires - declare author-only dependencies

SYNOPSIS
        author_requires 'Some::Module';
        author_requires 'Another::Module' => '0.42';

DESCRIPTION
    Modules often have optional requirements, for example dependencies that
    are useful for (optional) tests, but not required for the module to work
    properly.

    Usually you want all developers of a project to have these optional
    modules installed. However, simply telling everyone or printing
    diagnostic messages if optional dependencies are missing often isn't
    enough to make sure all authors have all optional modules installed.

    "Module::Install" already has a way of detecting an author environment,
    so an easy way to achieve the above would be something like:

        if ($Module::Install::AUTHOR) {
            requires 'Some::Module';
            requires 'Another::Module' => '0.42';
        }

    Unfortunately, that'll also make the optional dependencies show up in
    the distributions "META.yml" file, which is obviously wrong, as they
    aren't actually hard requirements.

    Working that around requires a considerable amount of non-trivial
    Makefile.PL hackery, or simply using this module's "author_requires"
    command.

COMMANDS
  author_requires
        author_requires $module;
        author_requires $module => $version;

    This declares a hard dependency, that's only enforced in author
    environments and is not put in the generate "META.yml" file of the
    distribution.
